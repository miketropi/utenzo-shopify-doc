This guide will walk you through the process of manually installing a Shopify theme. Follow these steps to set up your theme development environment and deploy your theme to a Shopify store.

## Prerequisites

Before installing a Shopify theme manually, ensure you have the following:

- **Shopify Store**: Access to a Shopify store (development store or live store)
- **Theme Files**: The theme files you want to install (either downloaded or cloned from a repository)
- **Code Editor**: A code editor like VS Code, Sublime Text, or similar
- **Shopify Admin Access**: Admin permissions to upload and manage themes

<Note title="Important" type="warning">
  Always backup your current theme before installing a new one. This ensures you can restore your store if something goes wrong during installation.
